          On February 1, 2023, we students and Professor Marie Joy Sanchez. We
          were given a tour of the offices and received instruction regarding
          the rules and perks of the company. The organization is welcoming and
          treats its staff well, especially because they typically work at night
          because its clients are Americans. Even though my employer is still
          teaching me everything, I still want to express how excited I am for
          this new chapter in my life.

          Graveyard shift is nevery easy! To be honest I'm personally still
          adjusting to the working schedule, I always feel sleepy during my
          shift, even a cup of coffee can't subside it, i shold probably take a
          cup of coffee every hour to avoid getting sleepy, but i think i can
          adjust to this working schedule environment through time. But forda
          future I would gladly take on this journey and do my very best.

          The work is challenging, being in a new environment is difficult and
          the duty of a data analyst is never easy. I've been struggling because
          my job involves a lot of calculations in Excel, and the last time I
          used it was in my first years of college at STI before my previous
          school. Although I am just starting out, I constantly tell myself that
          this is my trip and not other's, and that it is a marathon, not a
          sprint.

          I was able to adapt to the company and the skills needed to work here,
          which allowed me to thrive in my role and take on new challenges with
          confidence. Adapting has been key to my success in this position and
          has enabled me to continuously grow and develop both personally and
          professionally.By being adaptable, I have also been able to
          collaborate effectively with my colleagues and contribute to a
          positive work environment.

        <span class="post-date">WEEK 5</span>
        <p class="post-description">
          I was able to arrive early in the company and wanted to chill before
          going to work to face the challenges of the day with a clear and
          focused mind. Taking a few minutes to meditate or simply relax and
          enjoy a cup of coffee has helped me to reduce stress and improve my
          productivity. Chilling before work has become a daily ritual that I
          find essential for my well-being and success in the workplace.
          Moreover, by taking the time to chill before diving into work, I am
          able to approach tasks with a positive attitude
